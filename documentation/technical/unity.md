## Project Setup
- **Folder Structure**: Organize your project folders logically (e.g., `Assets/Scripts`, `Assets/Prefabs`, `Assets/Textures`, etc.).
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for all files and assets (e.g., `PascalCase` for scripts, `snake_case` for textures).
- **Project Settings**: Configure your project settings early (e.g., set up the default layers, tags, physics settings, and quality settings).

## Coding Standards
- **Code Style**: Follow a consistent coding style. Use descriptive variable and method names.
- **Component-Based Design**: Use Unity's component system effectively. Break down functionality into reusable components.
- **Script Organization**: Keep scripts short and focused on a single responsibility. Organize scripts into folders based on their purpose.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Comment your code where necessary and maintain good documentation.

## Asset Management
- **Asset Naming**: Use a clear naming convention for assets (e.g., `Enemy_Orc`, `Player_Character`, `UI_MainMenu`).
- **Asset Import Settings**: Optimize import settings for different asset types (e.g., textures, models, audio).
- **Prefab Usage**: Use prefabs for reusable objects and maintain a clean prefab hierarchy.

## Scene Organization
- **Scene Hierarchy**: Organize your scene hierarchy logically (e.g., group related objects together).
- **Empty GameObjects**: Use empty GameObjects as parent objects to group related objects and improve hierarchy readability.
- **Lighting and Post-Processing**: Set up lighting and post-processing effects early and adjust as needed.

## Performance Optimization
- **Batching**: Use static and dynamic batching to reduce draw calls.
- **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Implement LOD for complex models to improve performance.
- **Memory Management**: Monitor and manage memory usage. Use object pooling for frequently instantiated objects.
- **Physics Optimization**: Optimize physics calculations by adjusting collision detection modes and using simplified colliders.

## Testing and Debugging
- **Debugging Tools**: Use Unity
